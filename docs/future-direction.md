## Roadmap

This roadmap is based on community feedback. If there is a feature or something blocking you from using Liminal, please reach out to me and it will help me prioritize the Liminal roadmap!

- Achieve 100% parity with Entity Schemas (Current: ~80%)
    - Name template
    - Inventory settings
- Expand coverage to all Benchling schema types
    - Container schema
    - Box schema
    - Plate schema
    - Location schema
- Liminal automatically generates user-friendly validation reports
- Make validators on entity schemas labeled as decorators

The grand vision of Liminal is to expand its coverage to other LIMS systems. Liminal could become a community driven product that standarizes a code-first approach to interact with different LIMS systems. This would become a terraform-like product that allows mapping between different LIMS systems and allows users to control and define how they want to interact with their LIMS systems.
