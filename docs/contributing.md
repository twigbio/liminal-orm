    `poetry install --all-extras`

    Supported python versions of Liminal can be found in pyproject.toml. We recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage python versions.

6. Start developing :)

## Development cycle

Liminal uses [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks for enforcing formatting, linting, and mypy. Formatting and linting is done using [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) Every commit requires these to pass and you can run them manually using `pre-commit run` (use `-a` flag to run on all files). Commit with the `--no-verify` flag to avoid running the pre-commit hooks.

Please include tests when adding new functionality. Liminal uses [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing. Run this using `pytest liminal/` to run all tests. All tests must pass in order to merge in a Pull Request.

If making changes to the documentation (which is created using [`MKDocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)). Locally host and get a live preview of the website using `mkdocs serve`.

## Making a Pull Request

Contributions to the codebase must be made by submitting a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dynotx/liminal-orm/pulls) through your forked repository.
